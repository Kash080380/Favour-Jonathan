<p > Life is full of moments-big ones, small ones and the in-between ones we often overlook. 
    Think about the last time you truly pausedand just exist in the present.
    Maybe it was while drinking a warm cup of tea, or perhaps during a quiet evening where everything felt just right.
    These are the moment that reminds us what it means to be human </p>

    But life isn't always calm or perfect.
    There are messy days when the world feels too loud and nothing seems to go as planned.
    On those days it is easy to get lost in the chaos forgetting that better momment are just around the corner,yet even the hardest time, there is always something to hold on to-a
    smile from a stranger, a song that lift your spirit, or the steady comfort of knowing you have survived difficult days before.

    When we stop to think about it, so much of our happiness comes from the little things.
    The sound of birds in the morning , the laughterb of someone you love, or even just the way sunlight stream through a window.
    These are not grand gestures monumetal events-they are small,quiet and reminders that beauty exists everywhere if we choose to see it.

    Have you ever looked up to the stars on a close night?
    There is something magical about standing beneath the vastness of the sky, realizing how small we are in the grand scheme of things.
    It's humbling but also oddly confronting. The stars has been there for millions of years, staedy and unchanging, a slight neetness to all the joy and sorrow of the world.
